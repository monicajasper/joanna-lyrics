  <h4 id="#Clam,_Crab,_Cockle,_Cowrie">Clam, Crab, Cockle, Cowrie</h4>
  <p>
    That means no where I come from.<br>
    I am cold, out waiting for the day to come.<br>
    <br>
    I chew my lips, and I scratch my nose:<br>
    feels so good to be a rose.<br>
    <br>
    Oh don't, don't you lift me up<br>
    like I'm that shy, no no no no no,<br>
    just give it up —<br>
    There are bats all dissolving in a row<br>
    into the wishy-washy dark that cannot let go.<br>
    And I cannot let go,<br>
    and so I thank the lord, and I thank his sword!<br>
    'tho it be mincing up the morning,<br>
    slightly bored<br>
    <br>
    O, morning without warning like a hole,<br>
    And I watch you go.<br>
    There are some mornings<br>
    when the sky looks like a road.<br>
    There are some dragons<br>
    who were built to have and hold.<br>
    And some machines<br>
    are dropped from great heights lovingly.<br>
    And some great bellies ache with many bumblebees<br>
    (and they sting so terribly).<br>
    <br>
    I do as I please.<br>
    Now I'm on my knees.<br>
    Your skin is something that I stir into my tea.<br>
    And I am watching you<br>
    and you are starry, starry, starry<br>
    and I'm tumbling down, and I check a frown.<br>
    That's why I love this town.<br>
    Well, just look around<br>
    to see me serenaded hourly!<br>
    and celebrated sourly! and dedicated dourly;<br>
    waltzing with the open sea —<br>
    clam, crab, cockle, cowrie:<br>
    will you just look at me?<br>

  <h4 id="The Book_of_Right-On">The Book of Right-On</h4>  
  <p>
    We should shine a light on, a light on.<br>
    And the book of right-on's right on,<br>
    it was right on.<br>
    <br>
    We should shine a light on, a light on.<br>
    And the book of right-on's right on,<br>
    it was right on.<br>
    <br>
    I killed my dinner with karate —<br>
    kick 'em in the face, taste the body;<br>
    shallow work is the work that I do.<br>
    <br>
    Do you want to sit at my table?<br>
    My fighting fame is fabled<br>
    and fortune finds me fit and able.<br>
    <br>
    And you do say that you do pray,<br>
    and you say that you're okay.<br>
    <br>
    Do you want to run with my pack?<br>
    Do you want to ride on my back?<br>
    Pray that what you lack does not distract.<br>
    <br>
    And even when you run through my mind<br>
    something else is in front; you're behind.<br>
    And I don't have to remind you<br>
    to stick with your kind.<br>
    <br>
    And you do say that you do pray,<br>
    and you say that you're okay.<br>
    <br>
    And even when you touch my face<br>
    you know your place.<br>
    <br>
    And even when you touch my face<br>
    you know your place.<br>
    <br>
    We should shine a light on, a light on.<br>
    And the book of right-on's right on,<br>
    it was right on.<br>

  <h4 id="Sprout_and_the_Bean">Sprout and the Bean</h4>
  <p>    
    I slept all day<br>
    I woke with distaste<br>
    and I railed,<br>
    and I raved<br>
    <br>
    That the difference between<br>
    the sprout and the bean<br>
    it is a golden ring,<br>
    it is a twisted string.<br>
    And you can ask the councillor;<br>
    and you can ask the king;<br>
    and they'll say the same thing;<br>
    and it's a funny thing:<br>
    <br>
    Should we go outside?<br>
    Should we go outside?<br>
    Should we break some bread?<br>
    Are y'interested?<br>
    <br>
    And as I said,<br>
    I slept as though dead<br>
    dreaming seamless dreams of lead.<br>
    <br>
    When you go away,<br>
    I am big-boned and fey<br>
    in the dust of the day,<br>
    and in the dirt of the day.<br>
    <br>
    And the Danger! Danger!<br>
    Drawing near them was a white coat,<br>
    and Danger! Danger!<br>
    Drawing near them was a broad boat,<br>
    And the water! water!<br>
    Running clear beneath a white throat,<br>
    and the hollow chatter<br>
    of the talking of the tadpoles,<br>
    who know th'outside!<br>
    Should we go outside?<br>
    Should we break some bread?<br>
    Are y'interested?<br>
    </p>
    
  <h4 id="Bridges_and_Balloons">Bridges and Balloons</h4>
  <p>
    We sailed away on a winter's day<br>
    with fate as malleable as clay;<br>
    but ships are fallible, I say,<br>
    and the nautical, like all things, fades.<br>
    <br>
    And I can recall our caravel:<br>
    a little wicker beetle shell<br>
    with four fine masts and lateen sails,<br>
    its bearings on Cair Paravel.<br>
    <br>
    O my love,<br>
    O it was a funny little thing<br>
    to be the ones to've seen.<br>
    <br>
    The sight of bridges and balloons<br>
    makes calm canaries irritable;<br>
    and they caw and claw all afternoon:<br>
    Catenaries and dirigibles<br>
    brace and buoy the living-room —<br>
    a loom of metals, warp-woof-wimble.<br>
    And a thimblesworth of milky moon<br>
    can touch hearts larger than a thimble.<br>
    <br>
    O my love,<br>
    O it was a funny little thing<br>
    to be the ones to've seen.<br>
    <br>
    O my love,<br>
    O it was a funny little thing,<br>
    it was a funny funny little thing.<br>
  </p>
  
  <h4 id="En_Gallop!">"En Gallop!"</h4>
  <p>
    This place is damp and ghostly<br>
    I am already gone.<br>
    And the halls were lined<br>
    with the disembodied and the dustly wings,<br>
    which fell from flesh gasplessly.<br>
    <br>
    And I go where the trees go,<br>
    and I walk from a higher education<br>
    (for now, and for hire).<br>
    <br>
    It beats me, but I do not know.<br>
    And it beats me, but I do not know.<br>
    It beats me, but I do not know.<br>
    I do not know.<br>
    <br>
    Palaces and stormclouds<br>
    and the rough, straggly sage, and the smoke<br>
    and the way it will all come together<br>
    (in quietness, and in time).<br>
    <br>
    And you laws of property<br>
    you free economy<br>
    and you unending afterthoughts,<br>
    you could've told me before —<br>
    <br>
    Never get so attached to a poem<br>
    you forget truth that lacks lyricism;<br>
    and never draw so close to the heat<br>
    that you forget that you must eat.<br>

  <h4 id="Emily">Emily</h4>
  <p>
    The meadowlark and the chim-choo-ree and the sparrow<br>
    set to the sky in a flying spree, for the sport of the pharaoh.<br>
    Little while later, the Pharisees dragged a comb through the meadow.<br>
    Do you remember what they called up to you and me, in our window?<br>
    <br>
    There is a rusty light on the pines tonight;<br>
    sun pouring wine, lord, or marrow, into the<br>
    bones of the birches, and the spires of the churches, jutting out from the shadows;<br>
    the yoke, and the axe, and the old smokestacks, and the bale, and the barrow —<br>
    and everything sloped, like it was dragged from a rope, in the mouth of the south below.<br>
    <br>
    We’ve seen those mountains kneeling, felten and grey.<br>
    We thought our very hearts would up and melt away,<br>
    <br>
    from that snow in the nighttime,<br>
    just going and going<br>
    <br>
    and the stirring of wind chimes<br>
    in the morning<br>
    in the morning<br>
    <br>
    Helps me find my way back in<br>
    from the place where I have been —<br>
    <br>
    And, Emily, I saw you last night by the river.<br>
    I dreamed you were skipping little stones across the surface of the water —<br>
    frowning at the angle where they were lost, and slipped under forever,<br>
    in a mud-cloud, mica-spangled, like the sky’d been breathing on a mirror.<br>
    <br>
    Anyhow, I sat by your side, by the water.<br>
    You taught me the names of the stars overhead, that I wrote down in my ledger —<br>
    though all I knew of the rote universe were those Pleiades, loosed in December,<br>
    I promised you I’d set them to verse, so I’d always remember<br>
    <br>
    That the meteorite is the source of the light,<br>
    And the meteor’s just what we see;<br>
    And the meteoroid is a stone that’s devoid of the fire that propelled it to thee.<br>
    And the meteorite’s just what causes the light,<br>
    And the meteor’s how it’s perceived;<br>
    And the meteoroid’s a bone thrown from the void, that lies quiet in offering to thee.<br>
    <br>
    *<br>
    <br>
    You came and lay a cold compress upon the mess I’m in;<br>
    threw the windows wide, and cried amen amen amen.<br>
    The whole world stopped to hear you hollering.<br>
    And you looked down, and saw, now, what was happening:<br>
    <br>
    The lines are fading in my kingdom<br>
    (though I have never known the way to border them in);<br>
    so the muddy mouths of baboons and sows, and the grouse, and the horse, and the hen<br>
    grope at the gate of the looming lake that was once a tidy pen.<br>
    And the mail is late, and the great estates are not lit from within.<br>
    The talk in town’s becoming downright sickening.<br>
    <br>
    In due time we will see the far buttes lit by a flare.<br>
    I’ve seen your bravery, and I will follow you there<br>
    <br>
    And row through the nighttime,<br>
    so healthy,<br>
    gone healthy all of a sudden,<br>
    <br>
    In search of a midwife<br>
    who can help me<br>
    who can help me,<br>
    <br>
    help me find my way back in.<br>
    And there are worries where I’ve been.<br>
    <br>
    And say, say, say, in the lee of the bay<br>
    don’t be bothered.<br>
    Leave your troubles here,<br>
    where the tugboats shear the water from the water<br>
    (flanked by furrows, curling back, like a match held up to a newspaper).<br>
    <br>
    Emily, they’ll follow your lead by the letter.<br>
    And I make this claim, and I’m not ashamed to say I knew you better.<br>
    What they’ve seen is just a beam of your sun that banishes winter.<br>
    <br>
    Let us go! Though we know it’s a hopeless endeavor.<br>
    The ties that bind, they are barbed and spined, and hold us close forever.<br>
    <br>
    Though there is nothing would help me come to grips with<br>
    a sky that is gaping and yawning,<br>
    there is a song I woke with on my lips,<br>
    as you sailed your great ship towards the morning.<br>
    <br>
    *<br>
    <br>
    Come on home. The poppies are all grown knee-deep by now.<br>
    Blossoms all have fallen, and the pollen ruins the plow.<br>
    Peonies nod in the breeze,<br>
    and while they wetly bow<br>
    with hydrocephalitic listlessness,<br>
    ants mop up their brow.<br>
    <br>
    And everything with wings is restless, aimless, drunk and dour;<br>
    butterflies and birds collide at hot, ungodly hours.<br>
    And my clay-colored motherlessness rangily reclines —<br>
    Come on home, now! All my bones are dolorous with vines.<br>
    <br>
    Pa pointed out to me, for the hundredth time tonight,<br>
    the way the ladle leads to a dirt-red bullet of light.<br>
    <br>
    Squint skyward and listen —<br>
    loving him, we move within his borders:<br>
    just asterisms in the stars’ set order.<br>
    <br>
    We could stand for a century,<br>
    staring,<br>
    with our heads cocked,<br>
    in the broad daylight, at this thing:<br>
    <br>
    Joy,<br>
    landlocked in bodies that don’t keep —<br>
    dumbstruck with the sweetness of being,<br>
    till we don’t be.<br>
    Told: take this.<br>
    And eat this.<br>
    <br>
    Told: the meteorite is the source of the light,<br>
    And the meteor’s just what we see;<br>
    And the meteoroid is a stone that’s devoid of the fire that propelled it to thee.<br>
    <br>
    And the meteorite is just what causes the light,<br>
    And the meteor’s how it’s perceived;<br>
    And the meteoroid’s a bone thrown from the void that lies quiet in offering to thee.<br>
  </p>
  
  <h4 id="Only_Skin">Only Skin</h4>
  <p>
    And there was a booming above you,<br>
    that night black airplanes flew over the sea.<br>
    And they were lowing and shifting like<br>
    beached whales,<br>
    shelled snails,<br>
    as you strained and you squinted to see<br>
    the retreat of their hairless and blind cavalry.<br>
    <br>
    You froze in your sand shoal,<br>
    prayed for your poor soul;<br>
    sky was a bread roll, soaking in a milk-bowl.<br>
    <br>
    And when the bread broke —<br>
    fell in bricks of wet smoke —<br>
    my sleeping heart woke, and my waking heart spoke.<br>
    <br>
    Then there was a silence you took to mean something:<br>
    Run, sing,<br>
    for alive you will evermore be.<br>
    And the plague of the greasy black engines a-skulking<br>
    has gone east,<br>
    while you’re left to explain them to me —<br>
    released<br>
    from their hairless and blind cavalry.<br>
    <br>
    With your hands in your pockets,<br>
    stubbily running<br>
    to where I’m unfresh,<br>
    undressed and yawning —<br>
    <br>
    Well, what is this craziness?<br>
    This crazy talking?<br>
    You caught some small death<br>
    when you were sleepwalking.<br>
    <br>
    It was a dark dream, darlin;<br>
    it’s over.<br>
    The firebreather is beneath the clover.<br>
    Beneath his breathing there is cold clay, forever:<br>
    a toothless hound-dog choking on a feather.<br>
    <br>
    But I took my fishing pole (fearing your fever),<br>
    down to the swimming hole, where there grows a bitter herb<br>
    that blooms but one day a year, by the riverside —<br>
    I’d bring it here:<br>
    <br>
    Apply it gently<br>
    to the love you’ve lent me.<br>
    <br>
    While the river was twisting and braiding, the bait bobbed<br>
    and the string sobbed,<br>
    as it cut through the hustling breeze.<br>
    <br>
    And I watched how the water was kneading so neatly,<br>
    gone treacly,<br>
    nearly slowed to a stop in this heat;<br>
    in a frenzy coiling flush along the muscles beneath.<br>
    <br>
    Press on me,<br>
    we are restless things.<br>
    Webs of seaweed are swaddling.<br>
    And you call upon the dusk of the<br>
    musk of a squid:<br>
    shot full of ink, until you sink into your crib.<br>
    <br>
    Rowing along, among the reeds, among the rushes,<br>
    I heard your song, before my heart had time to hush it!<br>
    Smell of a stonefruit being cut and being opened.<br>
    Smell of a low and of a lazy cinder smoking<br>
    <br>
    And when the fire moves away,<br>
    fire moves away, son.<br>
    Why would you say<br>
    I was the last one?<br>
    <br>
    Scrape your knee: it is only skin.<br>
    Makes the sound of violins.<br>
    <br>
    And when I cut your hair, and leave the birds all of the trimmings,<br>
    I am the happiest woman among all women.<br>
    <br>
    And the shallow water stretches as far as I can see.<br>
    Knee deep, trudging along —<br>
    the seagull weeps ‘so long’ —<br>
    humming a threshing song —<br>
    <br>
    Until the night is over, hold on,<br>
    hold on;<br>
    hold your horses back from the fickle dawn.<br>
    <br>
    I have got some business out at the edge of town,<br>
    candy weighing both of my pockets down<br>
    till I can hardly stay afloat, from the weight of them<br>
    (and knowing how the commonfolk condemn<br>
    what it is I do, to you, to keep you warm:<br>
    Being a woman. Being a woman.)<br>
    <br>
    But always up the mountainside you’re clambering,<br>
    groping blindly, hungry for anything;<br>
    picking through your pocket linings —<br>
    well, what is this?<br>
    Scrap of sassafras, eh Sisyphus?<br>
    <br>
    I see the blossoms broke and wet after the rain.<br>
    Little sister, he will be back again.<br>
    I have washed a thousand spiders down the drain.<br>
    Spiders’ ghosts hang, soaked and<br>
    dangling silently, from all the blooming cherry trees,<br>
    in tiny nooses, safe from everyone —<br>
    nothing but a nuisance; gone now, dead and done —<br>
    Be a woman. Be a woman.<br>
    <br>
    Though we felt the spray of the waves,<br>
    we decided to stay, 'till the tide rose too far.<br>
    We weren’t afraid, cause we know what you are;<br>
    and you know that we know what you are.<br>
    <br>
    Awful atoll —<br>
    O, incalculable indiscreetness and sorrow!<br>
    Bawl bellow:<br>
    Sibyl sea-cow, all done up in a bow.<br>
    Toddle and roll;<br>
    teethe an impalpable bit of leather,<br>
    while yarrow, heather and hollyhock<br>
    awkwardly molt along the shore.<br>
    <br>
    Are you mine?<br>
    My heart?<br>
    Mine anymore?<br>
    <br>
    Stay with me for awhile.<br>
    That’s an awfully real gun.<br>
    I know life will lay you down,<br>
    as the lightning has lately done.<br>
    <br>
    Failing this, failing this,<br>
    follow me, my sweetest friend,<br>
    to see what you anointed,<br>
    in pointing your gun there.<br>
    Lay it down! Nice and slow!<br>
    There is nowhere to go,<br>
    <br>
    save up;<br>
    up where the light, undiluted, is<br>
    weaving, in a drunk dream,<br>
    at the sight of my baby, out back:<br>
    <br>
    back on the patio,<br>
    watching the bats bring night in<br>
    <br>
    — while, elsewhere,<br>
    estuaries of wax-white<br>
    wend, endlessly, towards seashores unmapped.<br>
    <br>
    *<br>
    <br>
    Last week, our picture window<br>
    produced a half-word,<br>
    heavy and hollow,<br>
    hit by a brown bird.<br>
    <br>
    We stood and watched her gape like a rattlesnake<br>
    and pant and labor over every intake.<br>
    <br>
    I said a sort of prayer for some rare grace,<br>
    then thought I ought to take her to a higher place.<br>
    Said, “dog nor vulture nor cat shall toy with you,<br>
    and though you die, bird, you will have a fine view.”<br>
    <br>
    Then in my hot hand, she slumped her sick weight.<br>
    We tramped through the poison oak, heartbroke and inchoate.<br>
    The dogs were snapping, and you cuffed their collars<br>
    while I climbed the tree-house. Then how I hollered!<br>
    <br>
    Well she’d lain, as still as a stone, in my palm, for a lifetime or two;<br>
    then saw the treetops, cocked her head, and up and flew.<br>
    (While back in the world that moves, often, according to<br>
    the hoarding of these clues,<br>
    dogs still run roughly around<br>
    little tufts of finch-down.)<br>
    <br>
    And the cities we passed were a flickering wasteland,<br>
    but his hand, in my hand, made them hale and harmless.<br>
    <br>
    While down in the lowlands, the crops are all coming;<br>
    we have everything.<br>
    <br>
    Life is thundering blissful towards death<br>
    <br>
    in a stampede<br>
    of his fumbling green gentleness.<br>
    <br>
    You stopped by;<br>
    I was all alive.<br>
    In my doorway, we shucked and jived.<br>
    And when you wept, I was gone;<br>
    see, I got gone when I got wise.<br>
    But I can’t with certainty say we survived.<br>
    <br>
    Then down and down<br>
    and down and down<br>
    and down and deeper,<br>
    stoke, without sound,<br>
    the blameless flames,<br>
    you endless sleeper.<br>
    <br>
    Through fire below,<br>
    and fire above,<br>
    and fire within,<br>
    <br>
    sleep through the things that couldn’t have been,<br>
    if you hadn’t have been.<br>
    <br>
    And when the fire moves away,<br>
    fire moves away, son.<br>
    And why would you say<br>
    I was the last one?<br>
    <br>
    All my bones, they are gone, gone, gone.<br>
    Take my bones, I don’t need none.<br>
    Cold, cold cupboard, lord, nothing to chew on!<br>
    Suck all day on a cherry stone.<br>
    Dig a little hole not three inches round —<br>
    Spit your pit in a hole in the ground.<br>
    Weep upon the spot for the starving of me!<br>
    Till up grows a fine young cherry tree.<br>
    When the bough breaks, what’ll you make for me?<br>
    A little willow cabin to rest on your knee.<br>
    Well, what will I do with a trinket such as this?<br>
    Think of your woman, who’s gone to the west.<br>
    But I’m starving and freezing in my measly old bed!<br>
    Then I’ll crawl across the salt flats, to stroke your sweet head.<br>
    Come across the desert with no shoes on!<br>
    I love you truly,<br>
    or I love no-one.<br>
    <br>
    Fire moves away. Fire moves away, son.<br>
    Why would you say that I was the last one?<br>
    Last one?<br>
    <br>
    Clear the room! There’s a fire, a fire, a fire.<br>
    Get going,<br>
    and I’m going to be right behind you.<br>
    <br>
    And if the love of a woman or two, dear,<br>
    could move you to such heights,<br>
    then all I can do<br>
    is do, my darling, right by you.<br>

  <h4 id="Go_Long">Go Long</h4>
  <p>
    Last night, again,<br>
    you were in my dream.<br>
    Several expendable limbs were at stake.<br>
    You were a prince, spinning rims,<br>
    all sentiments indian-given<br>
    and half-baked.<br>
    I was brought<br>
    in on a palanquin<br>
    made of the many bodies<br>
    of beautiful women.<br>
    Brought to this place, to be examined,<br>
    swaying on an elephant:<br>
    a princess of India.<br>
    <br>
    We both want the very same thing.<br>
    We are praying<br>
    I am the one to save you.<br>
    But you don't even own<br>
    your own violence.<br>
    Run away from home —<br>
    your beard is still blue<br>
    with the loneliness of you mighty men,<br>
    when your jaws, and fists, and guitars,<br>
    and pens, and your sugarlip,<br>
    but I've never been to the firepits<br>
    with you mighty men.<br>
    <br>
    Who made you this way?<br>
    Who made you this way?<br>
    Who is going to bear<br>
    your beautiful children?<br>
    Do you think you can just stop,<br>
    when you're ready for a change?<br>
    Who will take care of you<br>
    when you're old and dying?<br>
    <br>
    You burn in the Mekong,<br>
    to prove your worth.<br>
    Go long! Go long!<br>
    Right over the edge of the earth!<br>
    You have been wronged,<br>
    tore up since birth.<br>
    You have done harm.<br>
    Others have done worse.<br>
    <br>
    Will you tuck your shirt?<br>
    Will you leave it loose?<br>
    You are badly hurt.<br>
    You're a silly goose.<br>
    <br>
    You are caked in mud,<br>
    and in blood, and worse.<br>
    Chew your bitter cud.<br>
    Grope your little nurse.<br>
    <br>
    Do you know why<br>
    my ankles are bound in gauze?<br>
    (sickly dressage:<br>
    a princess of Kentucky)?<br>
    In the middle of the woods<br>
    (which were the probable cause),<br>
    we danced in the lodge<br>
    like two panting monkeys.<br>
    <br>
    I will give you a call, for one last hurrah.<br>
    And if this tale is tall, forgive my scrambling.<br>
    But you keep palming along the wall,<br>
    moving at a blind crawl,<br>
    but always rambling.<br>
    <br>
    Wolf-spider, crouch in your funnel nest.<br>
    If I knew you, once,<br>
    now I know you less.<br>
    In the sinking sand,<br>
    where we've come to rest,<br>
    have I had a hand in your loneliness?<br>
    <br>
    When you leave me alone<br>
    in this old palace of yours,<br>
    it starts to get to me. I take to walking.<br>
    What a woman does is open doors.<br>
    And it is not a question of locking<br>
    or unlocking.<br>
    <br>
    Well, I have never seen<br>
    such a terrible room —<br>
    gilded with the gold teeth<br>
    of the women who loved you!<br>
    Now, though I die,<br>
    Magpie, this I bequeath:<br>
    by any other name,<br>
    a Jay is still blue<br>
    <br>
    with the loneliness<br>
    of you mighty men,<br>
    with your mighty kiss<br>
    that might never never end,<br>
    while, so far away,<br>
    in the seat of the West,<br>
    burns the fount<br>
    of the heat<br>
    of that loneliness.<br>
    <br>
    There's a man<br>
    who only will speak in code,<br>
    backing slowly, slowly down the road.<br>
    May he master everything<br>
    that such men may know<br>
    about loving, and then letting go.<br>
  </p>
    
  <h4 id="Have_One_on_Me">Have One on Me</h4>
  <p>
    From the courtyard, I floated in<br>
    and watched it go down.<br>
    Heard the cup drop;<br>
    thought, 'Well,<br>
    that's why they keep them around.'<br>
    The blackguard sat hard, down,<br>
    with no head on him now,<br>
    and I felt so bad,<br>
    cause I didn't know how<br>
    to feel bad enough<br>
    to make him proud.<br>
    <br>
    By the time you read this,<br>
    I will be so far away.<br>
    Daddy longlegs, how in the world<br>
    am I to be expected to stay?<br>
    In the night —<br>
    in the night, you may hear me call<br>
    Pa, stay your hand<br>
    and steel your resolve.<br>
    Stay where you are,<br>
    so long and tall.<br>
    <br>
    Here's Lola — ta da! — to do<br>
    her famous Spider Dance for you!<br>
    Lighten up your pockets!<br>
    Shake her skirts and scatter, there,<br>
    a shrieking, six-legged millionaire<br>
    with a blight in his sockets.<br>
    <br>
    Miss Montez,<br>
    the Countess of Lansfeld,<br>
    appealed to the King of Bavaria,<br>
    saying, "Pretty papa,<br>
    if you are my friend —<br>
    mister daddy longlegs, they are at it again! —<br>
    Can I see you?"<br>
    <br>
    Poor Lola! A tarantula's mounting<br>
    Countess Lansfeld's<br>
    handsome brassiere,<br>
    while they all cheer.<br>
    <br>
    And the old king fell from grace,<br>
    while Lola fled,<br>
    To save face and her career<br>
    <br>
    You caught a fly, floating by,<br>
    Wait for him to drown in the dust;<br>
    drown in the dust of other flies,<br>
    whereby the machine is run,<br>
    and the deed is done.<br>
    Heaven has no word<br>
    for the way you and your friends<br>
    have treated poor Louis.<br>
    May god save your poor soul, Lola.<br>
    (But there is nothing I adore,<br>
    apart from that whore's black heart.)<br>
    <br>
    Well, doesn't that just beat all!<br>
    Miss Gilbert,<br>
    called to Castlemaine<br>
    by the silver dollar and the gold glitter!<br>
    Well, I've seen lots,<br>
    but never, in a million years,<br>
    would think to see you, here.<br>
    <br>
    Though the long road<br>
    begins and ends with you,<br>
    I cannot seem to make amends<br>
    with you, Louis.<br>
    When we go out,<br>
    they're bound to see you with me.<br>
    <br>
    At night, I walk in the park,<br>
    with a whip,<br>
    between the lines<br>
    of the whispering Jesuits,<br>
    who are poisoning you against me.<br>
    There's a big black spider<br>
    hanging over my door.<br>
    Can't go anywhere, anymore.<br>
    Tell me, are you with me?<br>
    <br>
    I called to you, several times,<br>
    while the change took place<br>
    and then arrived, all night,<br>
    and I died.<br>
    But all these songs,<br>
    when you and I are long gone,<br>
    will carry on.<br>
    Mud in your eye.<br>
    <br>
    You asked my hand,<br>
    hired a band.<br>
    "In your heart is all that you need;<br>
    ask and you will receive," it is said.<br>
    I threw my bouquet,<br>
    and I knocked 'em dead.<br>
    <br>
    Bottle of white, bottle of red.<br>
    Helpless as a child,<br>
    when you held me in your arms,<br>
    and I knew that no other<br>
    could ever love me as you loved.<br>
    Love me as you loved.<br>
    But help me! I'm leaving!<br>
    <br>
    I remember everything,<br>
    down to the sound of you shaving —<br>
    the scrape of your razor,<br>
    the dully-abrading black hair<br>
    that remained<br>
    when you clutched at me,<br>
    that night I came upstairs, half-dead,<br>
    and, in your kindness,<br>
    you put me straightaway<br>
    in the cupboard,<br>
    with a bottle of champagne,<br>
    and then, later, on a train.<br>
    <br>
    It was dark out, I was half-dead.<br>
    I saw a star fall into the sky,<br>
    like a chunk of thrown coal,<br>
    as if god himself spat<br>
    like a cornered rat.<br>
    <br>
    I really want you to do this for me,<br>
    will you have one on me?<br>
    <br>
    It was dark; I was drunk and half-dead,<br>
    and we slept, knocking heads,<br>
    sitting up in the star-smoking air,<br>
    knocking heads like buoys.<br>
    <br>
    Don't you worry for me!<br>
    Will you have one on me!<br>
    <br>
    Meanwhile, I will raise my own glass<br>
    to how you made me fast<br>
    and expendable,<br>
    and I will drink to your excellent health,<br>
    and your cruelty.<br>
    Will you have one on me?<br>
    <br>
    — helpless as a child,<br>
    when you held me in your arms,<br>
    and I knew that no other<br>
    could ever love me —<br>
    <br>
    From the courtyard, I floated in<br>
    and watched it go down.<br>
    Heard the cup drop;<br>
    thought, "Well, that's why<br>
    they keep them around."<br>
    The blackguard sat hard, down,<br>
    with no head on him now,<br>
    and I felt so bad,<br>
    cause I didn't know how<br>
    to feel bad enough<br>
    to make him proud.<br>
    <br>
    Well daddy longlegs, are you?<br>
    Daddy longlegs, are you?<br>
    Daddy longlegs, are you proud?<br>

  <h4 id="Divers">Divers</h4>
  <p>
    The diver is my love<br>
    (and I am his, if I am not deceived),<br>
    who takes one breath above, for every hour below the sea;<br>
    who gave to me a jewel<br>
    worth twice this woman's life (but would cost her less<br>
    than laying at low tide,<br>
    to see her true love phosphoresce).<br>
    <br>
    And in an infinite regress:<br>
    Tell me, why is the pain of birth<br>
    lighter borne than the pain of death?<br>
    I ain't saying that I loved you first,<br>
    but I loved you best.<br>
    <br>
    I know we must abide<br>
    each by the rules that bind us here:<br>
    the divers, and the sailors, and the women on the pier.<br>
    But how do you choose your form?<br>
    How do you choose your name? How do you choose your life?<br>
    How do you choose the time you must exhale,<br>
    and kick, and rise?<br>
    <br>
    And in an infinite capsize:<br>
    Like a bull tearing down the coast,<br>
    double hulls bearing double masts—<br>
    I don't know if you loved me most, but you loved me last.<br>
    <br>
    Recall the word you gave:<br>
    to count your way across the depths of this arid world,<br>
    where you would yoke the waves,<br>
    and lay a bed of shining pearls!<br>
    I dream it every night:<br>
    the ringing of the pail,<br>
    the motes of sand dislodged,<br>
    the shucking, quick and bright;<br>
    the twinned and cast-off shells reveal a single heart of white.<br>
    <br>
    And in an infinite backslide:<br>
    Ancient border, sink past the West,<br>
    like a sword at the bearer's fall.<br>
    I can't claim that I knew you best,<br>
    but did you know me at all?<br>
    <br>
    A woman is alive!<br>
    A woman is alive;<br>
    you do not take her for a sign in nacre on a stone,<br>
    alone, unfaceted and fine.<br>
    And never will I wed.<br>
    I'll hunt the pearl of death to the bottom of my life,<br>
    and ever hold my breath,<br>
    till I may be the diver's wife.<br>
    <br>
    See how the infinite divides:<br>
    and the divers are not to blame<br>
    for the rift, spanning distant shores.<br>
    You don't know my name,<br>
    but I know yours.<br>
